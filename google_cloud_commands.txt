## will install the virtual environment package which will let us create virtual environment in our virtual machine.

sudo apt install python3.11-venv 
## This command will help us install the virtual environment package and after this we will create our virtual environment.
## Now that we have our packages ready, we will create our virtual environment.

 python3.11 -m venv uberdedata
 ## This command helps us to create a virtual environment folder named 'uberdedata' inside our virtual machine.

source uberdedata/bin/activate
 ## To use this environment, we will use this command.

 ## inside the virtual environment, we will install python and pip again.

 python get-pip.py 
 ## Using this command we will install pip inside our virtual environment. 

pip --version
 ## Check pip version using this command to see if pip is installed properly.

## After this we will install pandas in our virtual environment and then we will move forward with MAGE configuration.

pip3 install pandas
## To install pandas in uberdedata.

## Now we will install MAGE on our machine.

pip3 install mage-ai
## Use this command to install MAGE on your virtual machine inside the virtual environment.
